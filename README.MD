# Project Description 
This is a team project that teachers us to use csv data to setup Pycharm with Docker, Flask, and MySQL.
Once our data is setup, we developed the following two features:
1. Add a chart from chart.js to incorporate our api data from the json endpoints. 
2. Create a login and registration process that includes email verification from SendGrid. 

Installation Instructions for Using the App with Docker:
1. Make sure you have docker desktop installed in your computer.
