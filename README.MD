# Final Team Project Description 
In this project we developed one unique feature per team member and integrated it into the database created 
during this course. The two features as seen in the screenshots below, is the ability to create a graph using the data
and an email verification process. 

The application was setup with Docker-compose, Flask, and MySQL
